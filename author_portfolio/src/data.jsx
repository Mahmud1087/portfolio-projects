      "The book talks about how a Muslim woman can generally improve her life (physically, mentally, emotionally, financially and spiritually). Women are mostly known to be sacrificial; putting others's needs before theirs. The Author, in her book reiterates the fact that one can't pour from an empty jug, i.e. you have to love yourself first before you can give out genuine love",

      "Dare To Thrive is a motivational book for Muslim women. The most beautiful feature of this book is the use of the endearing and familiar word 'sis' to address the reader. It kind of personalized the lessons for the reader. It is a good read for all seeking a better life and the best of the hearafter. ",
